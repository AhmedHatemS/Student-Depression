## 📌 Problem Statement  
Student depression is a growing concern worldwide, significantly affecting academic performance, personal growth, and overall well-being. Various factors, including academic pressure, financial stress, and social challenges, contribute to this issue. Identifying these factors and predicting at-risk students can help institutions implement targeted interventions and support programs.  

This project aims to address the following key questions:  
- What are the main factors contributing to student depression?  
- How can data modeling techniques be used to predict students at risk?  
- What insights can be leveraged to guide effective mental health support strategies?
